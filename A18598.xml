            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Queſtion</hi> moved by that other man unto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, touching the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that ſhould be ſaved: For, <hi>Then ſaid one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Lord, are there few that ſhall be ſaved?</hi> whereunto is adioyned our Saviors <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> directed not to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that moved the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Indeed, <hi>ſaith the Papiſticall Atheiſt,</hi> Sir, I have heard Preachers preach of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but me thinks, it is a very dangerous doctrine, able to drive men to deſpaire. <hi>Or,</hi> What? can they tell who ſhall be ſaved, and who ſhall be damned? Doe they know Gods ſecrets? When, I marvell, were they in heaven to ſpeake with God? <hi>Or,</hi> be not they men as well as others?

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> How needfull it is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to try whether ever hee entred or continueth in this way: and that in the foure particular paths.</head>
               <p>BY all that hath beene hitherto delivered, the doctrine being fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and abundantly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25238:113"/> confirmed: that namely, <hi>It is no eaſie matter, but of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and of great labour, to enter into life eternall.</hi>—And why? but becauſe the gate and way, leading to Chriſt the life, is but <hi>one:</hi> and that to fleſh and bloud, for both <hi>finding,</hi> and <hi>entring,</hi> and <hi>proceeding,</hi> and <hi>perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> in, ſtrait and narrow: if yet you expect the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for farther profit, it will, being marked, eaſily apply it ſelfe, by a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe, viz. firſt for <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:</hi> and ſecondly, for <hi>terror:</hi> thirdly, for <hi>Counſell:</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, for <hi>Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, for <hi>Inſtruction</hi> this may ſerve, to teach us to try our ſtate, whether we be in the way to life: by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25238:114"/> conſidering, whether wee have entred in at the right gate, and in what path we walke. And this is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this doctrine moſt neceſſary and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſince there is hardly any, but would moſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſure of this, that he is in the way to life, &amp; ſhal be ſaved when he dieth. Yea the Popiſh ignorant, vvho hath beene taught to hold it preſumption, for any to account himſelfe ſure of being ſaved, yet hath his joy in this, that hee is of a good beleefe, and hopeth vvell (though hee bee not ſure of it) that he ſhall go to heaven. But it is, you know, the counſell of S. <hi>Petr,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>to give all diligence, to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25238:114"/> make our calling and election ſure.</hi> Hovv meaneth he? in it ſelfe? no, for ſo from all eternitie, it vvas vvith God, in his immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: but rather, in our knowledge, and aſſurance of beliefe. And therefore in the contrary extreame, how confident may we find another number, of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant prophane ones in the vvorld, that howſoever they live an unholy &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life, yet are or ſeeme at leaſt to be ſecure, that they ſhall die an happy, and bleſſed death, and doubt they doe not, one vvhit of this, but they ſhal be ſaved. Hovvbeit, ſince vve have learned in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered, that it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:25238:115"/> is not ſo light a matter to attaine to heaven, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed poſſible at all, except vve enter in, and vvalke thorough the right gate and vvay, vvhich is but one and ſtrait, leading to life: it vvill be good for people, firſt to make trial of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ere they reſt ſecure, ſince every gate is not, what <hi>Iacob</hi> called <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 28 17</note> the <hi>gate of heaven;</hi> nor yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beaten vvay, a path to life: but ſome rather, of that ſort, vvhich the vviſe man noteth, which though <hi>it ſeemeh right to a man,</hi>

               <p>TO proceed now unto <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> a ſure gate, if it be ſincere and a certaine way to life: ſince many profeſſe obedience to the Lord, who, yet like to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſervants, be not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch as they ſhould be, for their Maſters credit, or, perhaps, doe but ſerve themſelves in the beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which they ſeeme to goe about. Therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo is our tryall neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if wee would with

               <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> if the gate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we be entred be right, it is that which God hath ſet up and preſcribed to us in his Word. Concerning which is that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25.
